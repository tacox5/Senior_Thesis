Here we will describe the parameterization of Ly$\alpha$ emission during reionization.
We adopt the techique developed in \cite{2013ApJ...763..132S} and applied in \cite{2017ApJ...848...52H}. While modeling
Ly$\alpha$ we focus two locations from which emission happens.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Ly$\alpha$ Emitters}:
\item \textit{Ionized Intergalactic Medium (IGM)}:
\end{enumerate}
