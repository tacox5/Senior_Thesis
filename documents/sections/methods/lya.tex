Here I will describe the parameterization of \lya\ emission during reionization.
I adopt the techique developed in \cite{2013ApJ...763..132S} and applied in \cite{2017ApJ...848...52H}.
While modeling \lya\, I focus two locations from which \lya\ emission originates.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{\lya\ Emitters (LAE)}: This is emission that originates from within the
              virial radius \lya\-emitting galaxies themselves. The dominate components
              that contribute to emission within these galaxies are hydrogen recombinations
              and collisional excitation.
\item \textit{Ionized Intergalactic Medium (IGM)}: This is emission that stems from the bubble
              of ionized gas that surround \lya\-emitting galaxies. In these ionized bubbles,
              X-ray/UV heating and scattering of Lyman-n photons as well as recombinations of
              ionized hydrogen are the dominate contributors to \lya\ emission.
\end{enumerate}
