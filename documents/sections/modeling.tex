In this section, I will discuss the effort to model the 21cm and Ly$\alpha$
cosmological signals that will be used for cross-correlation later in this work.
A significant amount of research has gone into the modeling effort of both 21cm and
Ly$\alpha$ fluctuations during the Epoch of Reionization. While N-body and radiative transfer
codes and analytic models accurately capture the physics of the evolution of
galaxies and the IGM at small scales.

Semi-numerical simulators on the other hand are much more computationally efficient at
modeling the large-scale evolution of the IGM throughout the process of reionziation.
For this work, I use the semi-numerical simulator of the cosmological 21cm signal,
21cmFAST, to generate the 21cm signal.
