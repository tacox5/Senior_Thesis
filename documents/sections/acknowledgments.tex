First and foremost, I would like to thank the research advisors I've had since
I've joined the Low-Frequency Cosmology Lab (in no particular order), Adam Beardsley,
Judd Bowman, and Danny Jacobs. I am incredibly appreciative of your mentorship,
advice, and support that you've given over these past two years and so grateful for the
opportunity to work with the HERA team. Thank you to my third committee member, Alex Van Engelen, for enthusiastically
agreeing to sit on my committee despite the late notice.
I would also like to thank my friends, fellow students, and members of the
Low-Frequency Cosmology Lab. In particular, I would like to
thank Shane Bechtel, Lily Whitler, and Samuel Nigh for their support and friendship.
They have all greatly enhanced my time here at ASU. Finally, I would like to send
a heartfelt thank you to my parents and sister for their constant love and encouragement.
