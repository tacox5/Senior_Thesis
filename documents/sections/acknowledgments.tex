First and foremost, I would like to thank my research advisors, Adam Beardsley
and Danny Jacobs.

To my committee members, Judd Bowman and blah. I can't thank you enough for blah.

I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues, who's endless encouragement
and blah helped to. In particular, I would like to thank Shane Bechtel, Lily Whitler,
Sam Nigh, and blah for their support over the last three years. Without them, I
surely would have dropped out years ago.

Most importantly, none of this could have been done without the love and support
of my family. To my sister, thank you for keeping me humble. To my Mom and Dad,
thank you for all you've done.
