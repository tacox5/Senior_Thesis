First and foremost, I would like to thank the many research advisors who made this
work possible, Adam Beardsley, Judd Bowman, Danny Jacobs, and Steven Murray.

I would also like to thank my third committee member, Alex van Engelen.

I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues, who's endless encouragement
and blah helped to. In particular, I would like to thank Shane Bechtel, Lily Whitler.

Most importantly, none of this could have been done without the love and support
of my family. To my sister, thank you for keeping me humble. To my Mom and Dad,
thank you for all you've done.
