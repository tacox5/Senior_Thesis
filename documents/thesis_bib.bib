	abstract = {We introduce a powerful semi-numeric modeling tool, 21cmFAST, designed to efficiently simulate the cosmological 21-cm signal. Our code generates 3D realizations of evolved density, ionization, peculiar velocity, and spin temperature fields, which it then combines to compute the 21-cm brightness temperature. Although the physical processes are treated with approximate methods, we compare our results to a state-of-the-art large-scale hydrodynamic simulation, and find good agreement on scales pertinent to the upcoming observations ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1 Mpc). The power spectra from 21cmFAST agree with those generated from the numerical simulation to within 10s of percent, down to the Nyquist frequency. We show results from a 1 Gpc simulation which tracks the cosmic 21-cm signal down from z=250, highlighting the various interesting epochs. Depending on the desired resolution, 21cmFAST can compute a redshift realization on a single processor in just a few minutes. Our code is fast, efficient, customizable and publicly available, making it a useful tool for 21-cm parameter studies.},

Cross-correlation information about the state of the IGM is obtained, testing neutral versus ionized medium cases with different tracers in a seminumerical simulation setup. In order to pave the way toward constraints on reionization history and modeling beyond power spectrum information, we explore parameter dependencies of the cross-power signal between 21\${\textbackslash},\$cm and Ly\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, which displays a characteristic morphology and a turnover from negative to positive correlation at scales of a couple Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.

	abstract = {We calculate the absolute intensity and anisotropies of the Lyman-alpha radiation field present during the epoch of reionization. We consider emission from both galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) and take into account the main contributions to the production of Lyman-alpha photons: recombinations, collisions, continuum emission from galaxies and scattering of Lyman-n photons in the IGM. We find that the emission from individual galaxies dominates over the IGM with a total Lyman-alpha intensity (times frequency) of about (1.43-3.57)x10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\} erg s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} sr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} at a redshift of 7. This intensity level is low so it is unlikely that the Lyman-{\textbackslash}alpha background during reionization can be established by an experiment aiming at an absolute background light measurement. Instead we consider Lyman-{\textbackslash}alpha intensity mapping with the aim of measuring the anisotropy power spectrum which has rms fluctuations at the level of 1 x 10{\textasciicircum}\{-16\vphantom{\{}\} [erg s{\textasciicircum}[-1\} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} sr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}]{\textasciicircum}2 at a few Mpc scales. These anisotropies could be measured with a spectrometer at near-IR wavelengths from 0.9 to 1.4 {\textbackslash}mu m with fields in the order of 0.5 to 1 sq. degrees. We recommend that existing ground-based programs using narrow band filters also pursue intensity fluctuations to study statistics on the spatial distribution of faint Lyman-{\textbackslash}alpha emitters. We also discuss the cross-correlation signal with 21 cm experiments that probe HI in the IGM during reionization. A dedicated sub-orbital or space-based Lyman-{\textbackslash}alpha intensity mapping experiment could provide a viable complimentary approach to probe reionization, when compared to 21 cm experiments, and is likely within experimental reach.},

	abstract = {We quantify the prospects for using emission lines from rotational transitions of the CO molecule to perform an `intensity mapping' observation at high redshift during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The aim of CO intensity mapping is to observe the combined CO emission from many unresolved galaxies, to measure the spatial fluctuations in this emission, and use this as a tracer of large scale structure at very early times in the history of our Universe. This measurement would help determine the properties of molecular clouds -- the sites of star formation -- in the very galaxies that reionize the Universe. We further consider the possibility of cross-correlating CO intensity maps with future observations of the redshifted 21 cm line. The cross spectrum is less sensitive to foreground contamination than the auto power spectra, and can therefore help confirm the high redshift origin of each signal. Furthermore, the cross spectrum measurement would help extract key information about the EoR, especially regarding the size distribution of ionized regions. We discuss uncertainties in predicting the CO signal at high redshift, and discuss strategies for improving these predictions. Under favorable assumptions, and feasible specifications for a CO survey mapping the CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) lines, the power spectrum of CO emission fluctuations and its cross spectrum with future 21 cm measurements from the MWA are detectable at high significance.},

	abstract = {With improving telescopes, it may now be possible to observe the Epoch of Reionization in multiple ways. We examine two of these observables - the excess light in the near-infrared background that may be due to high redshift stars and ionized HII bubbles, and the 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen. Because these two forms of emission should result from different, mutually exclusive regions, an anticorrelation should exist between them. We discuss the strengths of using cross-correlations between these observations to learn more about high redshift star formation and reionization history. In particular, we create simulated maps of emission from both the near-infrared background and 21 cm emission. We find that these observations are anticorrelated, with the strongest anticorrelation originating from times when the universe is half ionized. This result is robust and does not depend on the properties of the stars themselves. Rather, it depends on the ionization history. Cross-correlations can provide redshift information, which the near-infrared background cannot provide alone. In addition, cross-correlations can help separate foreground emission from the true high redshift component, making it possible to say with greater certainty that we are indeed witnessing the Epoch of Reionization.},

SPHEREx will carry out the first all-sky spectral survey and provide for every 6.2" pixel a spectra between 0.75 and 4.18 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m [with R\${\textbackslash}sim\$41.4] and 4.18 and 5.00 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m [with R\${\textbackslash}sim\$135]. The SPHEREx team has proposed three specific science investigations to be carried out with this unique data set: cosmic inflation, interstellar and circumstellar ices, and the extra-galactic background light. It is readily apparent, however, that many other questions in astrophysics and planetary sciences could be addressed with the SPHEREx data. The SPHEREx team convened a community workshop in February 2016, with the intent of enlisting the aid of a larger group of scientists in defining these questions. This paper summarizes the rich and varied menu of investigations that was laid out. It includes studies of the composition of main belt and Trojan/Greek asteroids; mapping the zodiacal light with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution; identifying and studying very low-metallicity stars; improving stellar parameters in order to better characterize transiting exoplanets; studying aliphatic and aromatic carbon-bearing molecules in the interstellar medium; mapping star formation rates in nearby galaxies; determining the redshift of clusters of galaxies; identifying high redshift quasars over the full sky; and providing a NIR spectrum for most eROSITA X-ray sources. All of these investigations, and others not listed here, can be carried out with the nominal all-sky spectra to be produced by SPHEREx. In addition, the workshop defined enhanced data products and user tools which would facilitate some of these scientific studies. Finally, the workshop noted the high degrees of synergy between SPHEREx and a number of other current or forthcoming programs, including JWST, WFIRST, Euclid, GAIA, K2/Kepler, TESS, eROSITA and LSST.},

	abstract = {Cross-correlation between the redshifted 21 cm signal and Lyman-\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} emitters (LAEs) is powerful tool to probe the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Although the cross-power spectrum (PS) has an advantage of not correlating with foregrounds much brighter than the 21 cm signal, the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds prevent detection since they contribute to the variance of the cross PS. Therefore, strategies for mitigating foregrounds are required. In this work, we study the impact of foreground avoidance on the measurement of the 21 cm-LAE cross-correlation. We then simulate the 21 cm observation as observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The point source foreground is modelled from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey catalogue, and the diffuse foreground is evaluated using a parametric model. For LAE observations, we assume a large survey of the Subaru Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC), with spectroscopic observations of the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). To predict the 21 cm signal, we employ a numerical simulation combining post processed radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics. Using these models, the signal-to-noise ratio of 2D PS shows the foreground contamination dominates the error of cross-PS even in the so-called `EoR window'. We find that at least 99\% of the point source foreground and 80\% of the galactic diffuse foreground must be removed to measure the EoR signal at large scales \$k{\textless}0.5 h {\textbackslash}rm Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Additionally, a sensitivity 80 times larger than that of the MWA operating with 128 tiles and 99\% of the point source foreground removal are required for a detection at small scales.},

While 3D intensity maps isolate foregrounds in low k\_{\textbackslash}parallel modes, infrared surveys cannot yet match the field of view and redshift resolution of radio intensity mapping experiments. In contrast, 2D (i.e., broad band) infrared intensity maps can be measured with current experiments and are limited by foregrounds instead of photon or thermal noise. We show 2D experiments can measure most of the 3D fluctuation power at k{\textless}0.2 Mpc{\textasciicircum}-1 while preserving its correlation properties. However, we show foregrounds pose two challenges: (1) simple geometric effects produce percent-level correlations between radio and infrared fluxes, even if their luminosities are uncorrelated; and (2) radio and infrared foreground residuals contribute sample variance noise to the cross spectrum. The first challenge demands better foreground masking and subtraction, while the second demands large fields of view to average away uncorrelated radio and infrared power. Using radio observations from the Murchison Widefield Array and near-infrared observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, we set an upper limit on residual foregrounds of the 21cm--Ly-alpha cross power spectrum at z{\textbackslash}sim7 of {\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}2{\textless}181 kJy/sr * mK (95{\textbackslash}\%) at {\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}sim800.

	abstract = {We discuss the prospects for ``tomography'' of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts using the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen. Existing observational constraints on the epoch of reionization imply a complex ionization history that may require multiple generations of sources. The 21 cm transition provides a unique tool to probe this era in detail, because it does not suffer from saturation effects, retains full redshift information, and directly probes the IGM gas. Observations in the redshifted 21cm line will allow one to study the history and morphology of reionization in detail. Depending on the characteristics of the first sources, they may also allow us to probe the era before reionization, when the first structures and luminous sources were forming. The construction of high signal-to-noise ratio maps on arcminute scales will require approximately one square kilometer of collecting area.},
